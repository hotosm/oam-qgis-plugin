About Open Aerial Map QGIS Plugin

OpenAerialMap QGIS plugin allows QGIS users to communicate with various OAM
services, acting as a desktop client for OAM. Through this plugin,
users can upload, search, and download imagery, as well as create and edit
the OIN-conformed metadata in a simple way.
It also supports some raster image processing such as reprojection and
file format conversion, as well as triggering the creation of tile services.

The current implementation consists of following three dialogs:

1) Upload wizard: create, modify, and upload imagery and metadata.
2) Imagery search dialog: search, browse, and download imagery.
3) Settings dialog: edit user settings such as the default
imagery metadata and upload options.

This plugin is currently experimental. We always appreciate your feeedback to
improve the code.
